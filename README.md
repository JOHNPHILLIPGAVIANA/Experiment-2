# Experiment-2
This repository contains two Python programs that were used to solve specific problems using NumPy. This experiment highlight techniques that are commonly used in data processing, such as normalization, reshaping arrays, and applying conditions to filter values. 

The first pproblem, called the Normalization Problem, generates a random 5x5 array with numbers between 0 and 1. Once the array is created, the program calculates its mean and standard deviation. These two values are then used to normalize the dataset using the formula (ùëã‚àímean)/standard¬†deviation (X‚àímean)/standard¬†deviation. Normalization is important because it adjusts the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which makes it easier to compare values fairly. After normalizing, the program saves the new array into a .npy file and prints the original data, the mean, the standard deviation, and the normalized results. This is the kind of process often seen in data science whenever raw data needs to be prepared before analysis. 

The second problem, called the Divisible by 3 Problem, works with integers from 1 up to 100. It first generates this range of numbers and then squares each one to create a new dataset. For better structure, the squared values are reshaped into a 10x10 matrix. The program then checks which of these squared numbers are divisible by 3 and collects only those values. Like in the first program, the filtered results are saved as a .npy file and also printed on the screen. This problem shows how NumPy can be used not just for calculations, but also for applying rules or conditions across an entire dataset in a very efficient way. 

Overall, these two problems serve as practical examples of what NumPy can do. The normalization problem demonstrates how statistical formulas can be applied directly to arrays, while the divisibility problem shows how reshaping and filtering can be used to manage and extract useful information from larger sets of numbers.
